# HangMan

A PyGame “HangMan” 

HangMan is a word-guessing two-player game in which one player creates a word to be guessed
then, all the letters of the word will be shown represented as dashes(-) and the guesser 
must pick an alphabet. If the alphabet is a part of the word, all letters of guessed alphabet 
will appear instead of the dashes. Using this concept, to achieve victory,
the guesser must guess the entire word or,guess all letters of the word, so to say. 
Now the part which makes the game "HangMan" is that there will also be a Gallow 
while the other player is guessing a word. Each time the other player guesses a wrong alphabet,
a part of a stickman will be drawn on the gallow. If the player fails to guess the word before the 
stickman is completed, the stickman will be complete and hanged, hence marking defeat of the guesser.

This is the concept behind HangMan.
